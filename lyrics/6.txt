TITLE: High Fashion
[Intro]
(Have you?)

[Verse 1]
Have you ever dreamt of bein' seen? (Ah)
Not by someone, more like in a magazine
Wantin' somethin' more than just a hit (Ah)
Nothing else can make me feel like this

[Pre-Chorus]
I know I'm drunk, but

[Chorus]
I don't need your drugs
I'd rather get, rather get high fashion
I don't want cheap love
I'd rather get high fashion
I don't need your drugs
I'd rather get, rather get high fashion
I don't want cheap love
I'd rather get high fashion

[Verse 2]
I'd rather feel the sun kiss on my skin (Ah)
With a cigarette pressed between my tits (Oh)
You know I'm not an easy fuck (Ah)
But whеn it comes to shoes, I'll be a slut

[Bridge]
Spiraling into you
I'm into you, denial
You make it hard, so hard to choose

I know how to make the hard things look really easy
Desire (Desire)
Ah, ah, ah, ah, I don't need you

I'd rather get, rather get, rather get
I'd rather get, rather get, rather get
I'd rather get, rather get, rather get
I'd rather get, rather get, rather get
I'd rather get, rather get, rather get

[Outro]
I don't need your drugs
Drugs
I don't want cheap love
High fashion
