[Intro]
Put your headphones on

[Chorus]

[Post-Chorus]
So I put my headphones on (I put my headphones on)
Listen to my favorite song (Listen to my favorite song)
Soaking up the rain (Ah)
Letting my hair down (Uh-huh)
So I put my headphones on
Come and put your headphones on

[Verse]
Wish my mom and dad could've been in lovе
Guess some things aren't mеant to last forever

You know I can't get enough
Gonna dance, gonna dance 'til the wheels fall off
'Til the wheels fall off
