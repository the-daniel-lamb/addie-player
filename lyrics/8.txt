[Verse 1]
Walk in the room, my high heels on, I strike a pose
Young, dumb, and cute, nothing to lose
And now the past is someone I have to answer for
I got a whole new point of view

[Pre-Chorus]
Misunderstood but I'm not gonna sweat it
Isn't it all for the show?
Keeping a smile on my face for protection
Turning my tears into gold

[Chorus]
So I cry (Cry)
Only in the rain (Only in the rain)
So I cry (Cry)
Only in the rain (Only in the rain)

[Verse 2]
Don't wanna be sad, God, it feels like a waste of time
Maybe it's fake but I don't care
You don't deserve my heart and guess what? I don't owe it to you
If you're offended, say a prayer

[Pre-Chorus]
Misunderstood but I'm not gonna sweat it
Isn't it all for the show? (Uh-huh)
Keeping a smile on my face for protection
Turning my tears into gold

[Chorus]
So I cry (Cry)
Only in the rain (Only in the rain)

All night, gonna cry in the rain
All night, gonna cry in the rain
All night, gonna cry in the rain
All night, gonna cry in the rain

[Chorus]
So I cry (Cry)
Only in the rain (Only in the rain)
So I cry (Cry)
Only in the rain (Only in the rain)
So I cry (Cry)
Only in the rain (Only in the rain)
So I cry (Cry)
Only in the rain (Only in the rain)

All night, gonna cry in the rain
All night, gonna cry in the rain
All night, gonna cry in the rain
All night, gonna cry in the rain
