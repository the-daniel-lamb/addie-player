[Verse 1]
Tell me who I am, do I provoke you with my tone of innocence?
Don't ask too many questions, that is my one suggestion
You know I keep it real, I live for the appeal
Knew it from the start, it was the only way to mend my broken heart
Don't ask too many questions, this is my one confession
It never was enough, I always wanted more
I always wanted more

[Chorus]
Fame is a gun and I point it blind
Crash and burn, girl, baby, swallow it dry
You got a front row seat and I
I got a taste of the glamorous life

[Verse 2]
There's no mystery, I'm gonna make it, gonna go down in history
Don't ask too many questions, God gave me the permission
And when you shame me, it makes me want it more
It makes me want it more, more

[Chorus]
Fame is a gun and I point it blind (Blind)
Crash and burn, girl, baby, swallow it dry (Dry)
You got a front row seat and I
I got a taste of the glamorous life (Life)
Love is a drug that I can't deny (Deny)
I'm your dream girl, but you're not my type
You got a front row seat and I
I got a taste of the glamorous life (Uh-huh)

Nothing makes me feel as good
As being loved by you

[Chorus]
Fame is a gun and I point it blind (Blind)

You got a front row seat and I

I'm your dream girl, but you're not my type
