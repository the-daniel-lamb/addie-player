TITLE: Aquamarine
[Chorus]
Aquamarine
Honey, dive into me
I'm not hiding anymore
I won't hide

[Verse 1]
The world is my oyster
Baby, come touch the pearl
The world is my oyster
And I'm the only girl

[Refrain]
I'm dancing in my own reflection
I'm the ray of light
I'm transforming and realigning
I'll take you with me, high, high, high, high

[Chorus]
Aquamarine
Honey, dive into me
I'm not hiding anymore
I won't hide
I'm free

[Verse 2]
Swimmin' in the sea with the salt in my hair
Kissed by the sun, it's a love affair
Heart of the Ocean around my neck
I don't have to say it, you know what's next

[Refrain]
I'm transforming and realigning
