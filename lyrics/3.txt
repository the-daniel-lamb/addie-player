[Intro]
When I was growing up
Mama always told me to save my money
So I never had to rely on a man to take care of me
But money's not coming with me to Heaven
And I have a lot of it
So, can't a girl have fun?
Can't a girl have fun? Can't a girl have fun?
Can't a girl have fun, fun, fun?

[Chorus]
Pocket full of sunshine, busting through the seams
Say it baby, don't lie
Money is everything
Diamonds are my best friend like I'm Norma Jeane
Say it baby, don't lie
Money is everything

[Post-Chorus]
Can't a girl have fun? Can't a girl have fun?
Can't a girl have fun, fun, fun?
Money is everything
Can't a girl have fun? Can't a girl have fun?
Can't a girl have fun, fun, fun?

[Verse 1]
Drink on the next side, I wanna remember
And when I'm up dancing, please DJ, play Madonna
Wanna roll one with Lana, get high with Gaga
And the girl I used to be is still the girl inside of me

[Chorus]
Pocket full of sunshine, busting through the seams
Say it baby, don't lie
Money is everything
Diamonds are my best friend like I'm Norma Jeane
Say it baby, don't lie
Money is everything

[Post-Chorus]
Pocket full of sunshine, busting through the seams
Say it baby, don't lie
Money is everything
Diamonds are my best friend like I'm Norma Jeane
Say it baby, don't lie
Money is everything
Pocket full of sunshine, busting through the seams
Say it baby, don't lie
Money is everything
Diamonds are my best friend like I'm Norma Jeane
Say it baby, don't lie
Money is everything

[Outro]
Money loves me
I'm the richest girl in the world
