TITLE: Summer Forever
[Intro]
Fears thrown out the window
Feel like summer forever

[Verse 1]
Loved until my parents said that it was "second time's the charm"
I never thought I'd find someone easily
Now I'm wrapped up in your arms and it feels just like a dream
Friends say I disappear, yeah, blame it on the things we do (Oh)

[Pre-Chorus]
Stayin' up all night long
Singin' our favorite songs
Makin' out in the car
Doin' shots at the bar
We're naked at the beach
Barefoot on the street
Background on my phone
Never felt this alone

[Chorus]
All these fеars thrown out the window
Makes it feel like summеr forever
And I truly think you're special
This love's one to remember
All these fears thrown out the window
Makes it feel like summer forever
And I truly think you're special
This love's one to remember

[Verse 2]
My 11:11, would you fly with me to Paris?
We could get real romantic and never, ever stop dancing
The edge feels safer I'm standin' on it with you (Oh)

[Pre-Chorus]
Stayin' up all night long (Night long)
Singin' our favorite songs (Favorite songs)
Makin' out in the car
Doin' shots at the bar (At the bar)
We're naked at the beach (At the beach)
Barefoot on the street (On the street)
Background on my phone
Never felt this alone

[Chorus]
All these fears thrown out the window
Makes it feel like summer forever
And I truly think you're special
This love's one to remember
All these fears thrown out the window
Makes it feel like summer forever
And I truly think you're special
This love's one to remember

[Bridge]
The things you said
I love you so bad (Bad)
The things you said
I love you so bad (Bad)
The things you said
I love you so bad (Bad)
The things you said
I love you so bad
This ain't my first time, but baby, I hope that it's my last
Want this to last (Oh)
[Chorus]
All these fears thrown out the window
Makes it feel like summer forever
And I truly think you're special
This love's one to remember
All these fears thrown out the window
Makes it feel like summer forever
And I truly think you're special
This love's one to remember

[Outro]
The things you said
I love you so bad
The things you said
I love you so bad
The things you said
I love you so bad
The things you said
