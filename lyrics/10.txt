[Verse 1]
I know you like when I wear this dress
I feel best when I'm wearin' less
If I dye my hair bleach blonde
Maybe then I'll turn you on
Tell you what I want tonight
What will it make me feel this time?
I'm so caught up in my head
Wanna take back what I said

[Pre-Chorus]
I'm so confused

[Chorus]
My life moves faster than me
Can't feel the ground beneath my feet (Ah-ah-ah-ah)
No matter what I try to do
In times like these, it's, it's how it has to be
Yeah, how it has to be

[Verse 2]
Don't wanna get too close, I'm scared
Do you hate me, or do you care?
Think about all the time I spent
Feelin' lost, but I'm found again
Should I jump in the unknown?
Or is it better to know how it unfolds?
Am I too young to be this mad?
Am I too old to blame my dad?

[Pre-Chorus]
I'm so confused

[Chorus]
My life moves faster than me
Can't feel the ground beneath my feet (Ah-ah-ah-ah)
No matter what I try to do
In times like these, it's, it's how it has to be
It's not my fate in the end
Let go of all that could've been (Ah-ah-ah-ah)
Don't matter what I try to do
In times like these, it's, it's how it has to be
Yeah, how it has to be

[Bridge]
Head out the window, my song on the radio
Head out the window, let's see you forego
Head out the window, my song on the radio
Head out the window, let's see you forego
I'm so confused, I'm so confused
Ah-ah-ah-ah
Ah-ah-ah-ah (It's not my fate in the end)
Ah-ah-ah-ah
Ah-ah-ah-ah (It's not my fate in the end)

[Chorus]
(Ah) My life moves faster than me
Can't feel the ground beneath my feet (Ah-ah-ah-ah)
No matter what I try to do
In times like these, it's, it's how it has to be (Ah)
It's not my fate in the end
Let go of all that could've been (Ah-ah-ah-ah)
No matter what I try to do (Try to do)
In times like these, it's, it's how it has to be
Yeah, how it has to be
[Outro]
Head out the window, head out the window
Head out the window, let's see you forego
